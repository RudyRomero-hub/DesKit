# DesKit
A code base for all developers and designers from newbies, to intermediate to advanced developers to share ideas and code of how various parts of a website can be built for inspirations for future projects.
This project is called DesKit and in this project, we will be coding up and showing creativity in creating and designing various parts of a website, ranging from headers, about sections, our team section, products section, features sections, log in forms, sign up forms, footers and many many more::::

WHY THIS PROJECT WAS STARTED:::
1. The main goal is to give all developers who have never collaborated before, an idea of how collaboration feels like and how it is done so that they will walk into their first jobs with full confidence and ready for code. 
1. A lot of newbies want to contribute towards something but the open source projects out there just feel too advanced for them.
1. People create wonderful designs and end up sharing screenshots for review by fellow developers, what if we had all these designs in one place for practice and designs? this is where DesKit repository will come in to share our creativity as a community in one place.

4. I have created an automatic horizontal scroll, find it there..
