
DesKit is an open source project for developers to share their design ideas and code on various parts of a website and how those parts can be built.
These parts range from headers, about sections, features sections, our team sections, footer, products section, login and sign up forms and many
many more.


Please follow the following instructions for the purposes of organization and efficiency by other developers who might be interested in your code

1. Create a folder and name it after the section you are designing followed by your name, for example, if you are designing a header and 
   your name is Chris, you can name the folder as header_chris.

2. Make sure you have an index.html file where others will be seeing your output for the purposes of inspiration in their future projects, correction e.t.c

3. NOTE::::YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO USE:

	HTML 5
	CSS3
	JAVASCRIPT
	JQUERY
	BOOTSTRAP
	if you are using other design libraries like caurosel libraries and such, please make sure you create a readme.txt or readme.md explaining
	how one can get started with such libraries
4. We really advice you to create a branch and work inside it then once done, push the branch to the remote repository where it will be 
	merged with the main branch.
      
5. Make sure your creations are responsive.

	=		 FOLLOW THESE EASY STEPS IF YOU HAVE NEVER COLLABORATED BEFORE:::::
	=		ensure you have git installed locally on your machine
 	=		1. Fork the project so that it gets copied to your git hub account.
 	=		2. Move into the project folder and create a branch as shown:
	=				git branch -m <branch name>  so that if you want your branch to be called heade_chris you will:
	=				git branch -m "header_chris"
 	=		3. Make sure you are in your branch using the following command:
	=				git checkout header_chris 
	=               4.Add your git hub username and link to the contributors.md file in the format shown below
	=                     -[@git hub username] (link to the github profile)
	=                     -[@codeme254] (https://github.com/codeme254)
 	=		5.Work on your idea.
 	=		6.Add your changes 
	=				git add .
 	=		7. Commit your changes.
	=				git commit -m "created a header section of a website"
 	=		8. Push the changes to remote branch using the follwing command
	=				git push origin <branch name>
	=       			git push origin header_chris
 	=		9. Finally, make a pull request, and tag the maintainer of the code in your pull request
   	=		 Note that the maintainer is codeme254
	=				sample pull request with a tag:  please review and merge my code @codeme254

	OPTIONAL, INSIDE YOUR FOLDER, YOU CAN CREATE A README.MD FILE AND LEAVE YOUR DETAILS THERE FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONNECTING WITH OTHER DEVELOPERS
	AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME FREELANCE JOBS AS SOMEONE MIGHT BE HIGHLY INTERESTED IN YOUR DESIGN AND WANTS IT IN HIS OR HER PRODUCT............

	HAPPY HACKING!!!!!!!
